    Inspired by our love for soccer, strategic thinking and the game of football we used to play on notebook,
    <br>we set out to create a game that 
    <br>captures the excitement of the sport while adding a unique twist.
    <br>Drawing from our own experiences as sportsman and developers,
    <br>we've crafted gameplay that emphasizes teamwork,
    strategy, and skill.
